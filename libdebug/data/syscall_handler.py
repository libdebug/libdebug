    Attributes:
        syscall_number (int): The syscall number to handle.
        thread_id (int): The thread id of the thread for which the syscall will be handled. If -1, the syscall will be handled on all threads.
        on_enter_user (Callable[[ThreadContext, int], None]): The callback defined by the user to execute when the syscall is entered.
        on_exit_user (Callable[[ThreadContext, int], None]): The callback defined by the user to execute when the syscall is exited.
        on_enter_pprint (Callable[[ThreadContext, int], None]): The callback defined by the pretty print to execute when the syscall is entered.
        on_exit_pprint (Callable[[ThreadContext, int], None]): The callback defined by the pretty print to execute when the syscall is exited.
        recursive (bool): Whether, when the syscall is hijacked with another one, the syscall handler associated with the new syscall should be considered as well. Defaults to False.
        enabled (bool): Whether the syscall will be handled or not.
        hit_count (int): The number of times the syscall has been handled.
