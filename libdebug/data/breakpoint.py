class Breakpoint:
    """A breakpoint in the target process.

    Attributes:
        address (int): The address of the breakpoint in the target process.
        symbol (str): The symbol, if available, of the breakpoint in the target process.
        thread_id (int): The thread ID of the thread for which the breakpoint should be set. Defaults to -1, which means all threads.
        hit_count (int): The number of times this specific breakpoint has been hit.
        hardware (bool): Whether the breakpoint is a hardware breakpoint or not.
        callback (Callable[[ThreadContext, Breakpoint], None]): The callback defined by the user to execute when the breakpoint is hit.
        condition (str): The breakpoint condition. Available values are "X", "W", "RW". Supported only for hardware breakpoints.
        length (int): The length of the breakpoint area. Supported only for hardware breakpoints.
        enabled (bool): Whether the breakpoint is enabled or not.
