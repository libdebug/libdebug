## :material-lightning-bolt: Quick Start
Welcome to **libdebug**! This powerful Python library can be used to debug your binary executables programmatically, providing a robust, user-friendly interface. Debugging multithreaded applications can be a nightmare, but **libdebug** has you covered. Hijack and manage signals and syscalls with a simple API.

!!! INFO "Supported Systems"
    **libdebug** currently supports Linux under the x86_64, x86 and ARM64 architectures. Other operating systems and architectures are not supported at this time.

## Installation
Installing **libdebug** is as simple as running the following command:

=== "stable"
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install libdebug
    ```

If you want to test your installation when installing from source, we provide a suite of tests that you can run:

```bash title="Testing your installation"
git clone https://github.com/libdebug/libdebug
cd libdebug/test
python run_suite.py
```

For more advanced users, you can also build **libdebug** from source. Please refer to the [Building libdebug from source](development/building_libdebug.md) page for more information.

## Your First Script
Now that you have **libdebug** installed, you can start using it in your scripts. Here is a simple example of how to use **libdebug** to debug an executable:

```python title="libdebug's Hello World!"
from libdebug import debugger

d = debugger("./test") # (1)!

# Start debugging from the entry point
d.run() # (2)!

my_breakpoint = d.breakpoint("function") # (3)!

# Continue the execution until the breakpoint is hit
d.cont() # (4)!

# Print RAX
print(f"RAX is {hex(d.regs.rax)}") # (5)!
```

1. A debugger is created for the `test` executable
2. The process is spawned and the entry point is reached
3. A breakpoint is placed at the symbol `<function>` in the binary
4. A continuation command is issued, execution resumes
5. The value of the RAX register is read and printed

## Conflicts with other Python packages
!!! BUG "Using pwntools alongside **libdebug**"
    The current version of **libdebug** is incompatible with [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools).

    While having both installed in your Python environment is not a problem, starting a process with pwntools in a **libdebug** script will cause unexpected behaviors as a result of some race conditions.

Examples of some known issues include:

- `ptrace` not intercepting SIGTRAP signals when the process is run with pwntools. This behavior is described in [:octicons-issue-opened-24: Issue #48](https://github.com/libdebug/libdebug/issues/48).
- Attaching **libdebug** to a process that was started with pwntools with `shell=True` will cause the process to attach to the shell process instead. This behavior is described in [:octicons-issue-opened-24: Issue #57](https://github.com/libdebug/libdebug/issues/57).

## :fontawesome-solid-clock-rotate-left: Older versions of the documentation
The documentation for versions of **libdebug** older that 0.7.0 has to be accessed manually at [http://docs.libdebug.org/archive/VERSION](http://docs.libdebug.org/archive/VERSION), where `VERSION` is the version number you are looking for.
